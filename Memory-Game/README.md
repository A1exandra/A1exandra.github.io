# Memory Game

Hi,
This is *Memory Game*, a match-2 type game.
You click on one of those rectangle shapes that is actually the back of a playing card and the shape flips to reveal its underlying symbol.

## Play the game

- click on a card, a symbol will come up. Remember it.
- click on another card. *If the symbols  match* it’ll keep the symbol on, if not they’ll both flip again.
-  to win the game you have to match all 8 pairs of symbols scattered all over deck.

## General rules

- the rectangles are cards flipped over back
- the game records your number of moves so 2 flipped cards = 1 move.
- there are 8 pairs of cards
- you start the game with 3 stars, that’s your rating.
 >  At 14 moves you lose a star.
 >  At 22 moves you lose another and you’re left with one until the end.
- to ***reset*** the game just press refresh
- time is recorded on the left and it does *not affect your score*
